Hi, I am Pavol, a developer and tech enthusiast who is passionate about exploring cutting-edge tools and technologies.

I am deeply invested in the power of digital innovation to transform the way we learn and work as a developer of educational applications. I co-founded the teacher platform H-edu and the online virtual whiteboard Collboard.

I have worked on several citizen science projects for the Czech Society for Ornithology (CSO), using technology to improve our understanding of the natural world. For example, I developed the first mobile app for birdwatchers in the Czech Republic, which helped people identify bird species and report their sightings. I have also contributed to an international bird census with ornithological associations in Germany, Switzerland and Austria.

I have also developed my own online browser game, Towns, and worked on many other interesting projects.

Besides development, I speak at technology and startup conferences such as DevConf, LinuxDays, OpenAlt, and Czech VR Fest, and I have also spoken at meetups such as Frontendisti, ITnetwork.cz, and Jobs Dev. I enjoy sharing my expertise on topics such as VR, AR, WebGL, Web3, Blockchain, and AI, and have been invited to many events as a keynote speaker.

As someone who is always on the lookout for interesting events, I have started a newsletter to share my findings with others. Czech.events is a platform that helps people find and attend technology and innovation events in the Czech Republic.

I am a big techno-optimist, always looking forward to the future and excited to see what new innovations will emerge. With a talent for identifying opportunities for innovation and growth, I am eager to help companies and start-ups stay ahead of the curve with cutting-edge technologies. I have mentored and judged several startup and innovation competitions and am proud to say that I have won several of them. Through my work, I am committed to mentoring and inspiring others, and I believe that technology can help us solve many of the world's problems.
